Subject: [PATCH 3068/3390] ceph: fix statvfs fr_size

commit 92a49fb0f79f3300e6e50ddf56238e70678e4202 upstream.

Different versions of glibc are broken in different ways, but the short of
it is that for the time being, frsize should == bsize, and be used as the
multiple for the blocks, free, and available fields.  This mirrors what is
done for NFS.  The previous reporting of the page size for frsize meant
that newer glibc and df would report a very small value for the fs size.

Fixes http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/3793.
