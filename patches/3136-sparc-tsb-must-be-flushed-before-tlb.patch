Subject: [PATCH 3136/3390] sparc: tsb must be flushed before tlb

upstream commit 23a01138efe216f8084cfaa74b0b90dd4b097441

This fixes a race where a cpu may re-load a tlb from a stale tsb right
after it has been flushed by a remote function call.

I still see some instability when stressing the system with parallel
kernel builds while creating memory pressure by writing to
/proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages, but this patch improves the stability
significantly.
