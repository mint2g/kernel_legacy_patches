Subject: [PATCH 1601/3390] md/raid10: Don't try to recovery unmatched (and
 unused) chunks.

commit fc448a18ae6219af9a73257b1fbcd009efab4a81 upstream.

If a RAID10 has an odd number of chunks - as might happen when there
are an odd number of devices - the last chunk has no pair and so is
not mirrored.  We don't store data there, but when recovering the last
device in an array we retry to recover that last chunk from a
non-existent location.  This results in an error, and the recovery
aborts.

When we get to that last chunk we should just stop - there is nothing
more to do anyway.

This bug has been present since the introduction of RAID10, so the
patch is appropriate for any -stable kernel.
