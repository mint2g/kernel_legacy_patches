Subject: [PATCH 2406/3390] mfd: Only unregister platform devices allocated by
 the mfd core

commit b9fbb62eb61452d728c39b2e5020739c575aac53 upstream.

mfd_remove_devices would iterate over all devices sharing a parent with
an mfd device regardless of whether they were allocated by the mfd core
or not. This especially caused problems when the device structure was
not contained within a platform_device, because to_platform_device is
used on each device pointer.

This patch defines a device_type for mfd devices and checks this is
present from mfd_remove_devices_fn before processing the device.
