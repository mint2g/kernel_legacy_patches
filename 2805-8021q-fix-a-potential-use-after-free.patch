Subject: [PATCH 2805/3390] 8021q: fix a potential use-after-free

[ Upstream commit 4a7df340ed1bac190c124c1601bfc10cde9fb4fb ]

vlan_vid_del() could possibly free ->vlan_info after a RCU grace
period, however, we may still refer to the freed memory area
by 'grp' pointer. Found by code inspection.

This patch moves vlan_vid_del() as behind as possible.
