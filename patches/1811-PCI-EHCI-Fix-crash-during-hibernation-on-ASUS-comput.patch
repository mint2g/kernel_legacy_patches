Subject: [PATCH 1811/3390] PCI: EHCI: Fix crash during hibernation on ASUS
 computers

commit 0b68c8e2c3afaf9807eb1ebe0ccfb3b809570aa4 upstream.

Commit dbf0e4c (PCI: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS
computers) added a workaround for an ASUS suspend issue related to
USB EHCI and a bug in a number of ASUS BIOSes that attempt to shut
down the EHCI controller during system suspend if its PCI command
register doesn't contain 0 at that time.

It turns out that the same workaround is necessary in the analogous
hibernation code path, so add it.
