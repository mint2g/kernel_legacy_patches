Subject: [PATCH 2487/3390] serial: 8250, increase PASS_LIMIT

commit e7328ae1848966181a7ac47e8ae6cddbd2cf55f3 upstream.

With virtual machines like qemu, it's pretty common to see "too much
work for irq4" messages nowadays. This happens when a bunch of output
is printed on the emulated serial console. This is caused by too low
PASS_LIMIT. When ISR loops more than the limit, it spits the message.

I've been using a kernel with doubled the limit and I couldn't see no
problems. Maybe it's time to get rid of the message now?
