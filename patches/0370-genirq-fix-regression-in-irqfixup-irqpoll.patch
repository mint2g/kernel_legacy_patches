Subject: [PATCH 0370/3390] genirq: fix regression in irqfixup, irqpoll
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 52553ddffad76ccf192d4dd9ce88d5818f57f62a upstream.

Commit fa27271bc8d2("genirq: Fixup poll handling") introduced a
regression that broke irqfixup/irqpoll for some hardware configurations.

Amidst reorganizing 'try_one_irq', that patch removed a test that
checked for 'action->handler' returning IRQ_HANDLED, before acting on
the interrupt.  Restoring this test back returns the functionality lost
since 2.6.39.  In the current set of tests, after 'action' is set, it
must precede '!action->next' to take effect.

With this and my previous patch to irq/spurious.c, c75d720fca8a, all
IRQ regressions that I have encountered are fixed.
