Subject: [PATCH 2744/3390] IPoIB: Fix send lockup due to missed TX completion

commit 1ee9e2aa7b31427303466776f455d43e5e3c9275 upstream.

Commit f0dc117abdfa ("IPoIB: Fix TX queue lockup with mixed UD/CM
traffic") attempts to solve an issue where unprocessed UD send
completions can deadlock the netdev.

The patch doesn't fully resolve the issue because if more than half
the tx_outstanding's were UD and all of the destinations are RC
reachable, arming the CQ doesn't solve the issue.

This patch uses the IB_CQ_REPORT_MISSED_EVENTS on the
ib_req_notify_cq().  If the rc is above 0, the UD send cq completion
callback is called directly to re-arm the send completion timer.

This issue is seen in very large parallel filesystem deployments
and the patch has been shown to correct the issue.
