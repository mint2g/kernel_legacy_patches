Subject: [PATCH 0338/3390] xfs: Fix possible memory corruption in xfs_readlink

commit b52a360b2aa1c59ba9970fb0f52bbb093fcc7a24 upstream.

Fixes a possible memory corruption when the link is larger than
MAXPATHLEN and XFS_DEBUG is not enabled. This also remove the
S_ISLNK assert, since the inode mode is checked previously in
xfs_readlink_by_handle() and via VFS.

Updated to address concerns raised by Ben Hutchings about the loose
attention paid to 32- vs 64-bit values, and the lack of handling a
potentially negative pathlen value:
 - Changed type of "pathlen" to be xfs_fsize_t, to match that of
   ip->i_d.di_size
 - Added checking for a negative pathlen to the too-long pathlen
   test, and generalized the message that gets reported in that case
   to reflect the change
As a result, if a negative pathlen were encountered, this function
would return EFSCORRUPTED (and would fail an assertion for a debug
build)--just as would a too-long pathlen.
