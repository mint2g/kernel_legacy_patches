Subject: [PATCH 0225/3390] xen/blkback: Report VBD_WSECT (wr_sect) properly.

commit 5c62cb48602dba95159c81ffeca179d3852e25be upstream.

We did not increment the amount of sectors written to disk
b/c we tested for the == WRITE which is incorrect - as the
operations are more of WRITE_FLUSH, WRITE_ODIRECT. This patch
fixes it by doing a & WRITE check.
