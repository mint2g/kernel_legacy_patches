Subject: [PATCH 3128/3390] SCSI: zfcp: fix adapter (re)open recovery while
 link to SAN is down

commit f76ccaac4f82c463a037aa4a1e4ccb85c7011814 upstream.

FCP device remains in status ERP_FAILED when device is switched online
or adapter recovery is triggered  while link to SAN is down.

When Exchange Configuration Data command returns the FSF status
FSF_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA_INCOMPLETE it aborts the exchange process.
The only retries are done during the common error recovery procedure
(i.e. max. 3 retries with 8sec sleep between) and remains in status
ERP_FAILED with QDIO down.

This commit reverts the commit 0df138476c8306478d6e726f044868b4bccf411c
(zfcp: Fix adapter activation on link down).
When FSF status FSF_EXCHANGE_CONFIG_DATA_INCOMPLETE is received the
adapter recovery will be finished without any retries. QDIO will be
up now and status changes such as LINK UP will be received now.
