Subject: [PATCH 0227/3390] hpsa: add small delay when using PCI Power
 Management to reset for kump

commit c4853efec665134b2e6fc9c13447323240980351 upstream.

The P600 requires a small delay when changing states. Otherwise we may think
the board did not reset and we bail. This for kdump only and is particular
to the P600.
