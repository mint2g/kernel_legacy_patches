Subject: [PATCH 0454/3390] Make TASKSTATS require root access
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 1a51410abe7d0ee4b1d112780f46df87d3621043 upstream.

Ok, this isn't optimal, since it means that 'iotop' needs admin
capabilities, and we may have to work on this some more.  But at the
same time it is very much not acceptable to let anybody just read
anybody elses IO statistics quite at this level.

Use of the GENL_ADMIN_PERM suggested by Johannes Berg as an alternative
to checking the capabilities by hand.
