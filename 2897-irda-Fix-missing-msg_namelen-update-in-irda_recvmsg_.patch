Subject: [PATCH 2897/3390] irda: Fix missing msg_namelen update in
 irda_recvmsg_dgram()

[ Upstream commit 5ae94c0d2f0bed41d6718be743985d61b7f5c47d ]

The current code does not fill the msg_name member in case it is set.
It also does not set the msg_namelen member to 0 and therefore makes
net/socket.c leak the local, uninitialized sockaddr_storage variable
to userland -- 128 bytes of kernel stack memory.

Fix that by simply setting msg_namelen to 0 as obviously nobody cared
about irda_recvmsg_dgram() not filling the msg_name in case it was
set.
