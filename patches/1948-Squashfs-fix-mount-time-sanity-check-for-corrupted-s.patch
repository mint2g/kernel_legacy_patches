Subject: [PATCH 1948/3390] Squashfs: fix mount time sanity check for corrupted
 superblock

commit cc37f75a9ffbbfcb1c3297534f293c8284e3c5a6 upstream.

A Squashfs filesystem containing nothing but an empty directory,
although unusual and ultimately pointless, is still valid.

The directory_table >= next_table sanity check rejects these
filesystems as invalid because the directory_table is empty and
equal to next_table.
