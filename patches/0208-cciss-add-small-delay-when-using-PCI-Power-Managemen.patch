Subject: [PATCH 0208/3390] cciss: add small delay when using PCI Power
 Management to reset for kump

commit ab5dbebe33e0c353e8545f09c34553ac3351dad6 upstream.

The P600 requires a small delay when changing states. Otherwise we may think
the board did not reset and we bail. This for kdump only and is particular
to the P600.
