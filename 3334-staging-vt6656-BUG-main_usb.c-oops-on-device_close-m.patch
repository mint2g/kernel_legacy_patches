Subject: [PATCH 3334/3390] staging: vt6656: [BUG] main_usb.c oops on
 device_close move flag earlier.

commit e3eb270fab7734427dd8171a93e4946fe28674bc upstream.

The vt6656 is prone to resetting on the usb bus.

It seems there is a race condition and wpa supplicant is
trying to open the device via iw_handlers before its actually
closed at a stage that the buffers are being removed.

The device is longer considered open when the
buffers are being removed. So move ~DEVICE_FLAGS_OPENED
flag to before freeing the device buffers.
