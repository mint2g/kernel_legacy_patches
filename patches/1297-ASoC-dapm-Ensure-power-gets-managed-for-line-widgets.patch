Subject: [PATCH 1297/3390] ASoC: dapm: Ensure power gets managed for line
 widgets

commit 7e1f7c8a6e517900cd84da1b8ae020f08f286c3b upstream.

Line widgets had not been included in either the power up or power down
sequences so if a widget had an event associated with it that event would
never be run. Fix this minimally by adding them to the sequences, we
should probably be doing away with the specific widget types as they all
have the same priority anyway.
