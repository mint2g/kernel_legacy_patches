Subject: [PATCH 2592/3390] drm/usb: bind driver to correct device

commit 9f23de52b64f7fb801fd76f3dd8651a0dc89187b upstream.

While looking at plymouth on udl I noticed that plymouth was trying
to use its fb plugin not its drm one, it was trying to drmOpen a driver called
usb not udl, noticed that we actually had out driver pointing at the wrong
device.
