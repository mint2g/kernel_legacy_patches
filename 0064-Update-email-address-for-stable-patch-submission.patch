Subject: [PATCH 0064/3390] Update email address for stable patch submission

commit 5fa224295f0e0358c8bc0e5390702338df889def upstream.

The stable@kernel.org email address has been replaced with the
stable@vger.kernel.org mailing list.  Change the stable kernel rules to
reference the new list instead of the semi-defunct email alias.
