Subject: [PATCH 1438/3390] drm/i915: don't clobber the pipe param in
 sanitize_modesetting

commit a9dcf84b14ef4e9a609910367576995e6f32f3dc upstream.

... we need it later on in the function to clean up pipe <-> plane
associations. This regression has been introduced in

    drm/i915: Sanitize BIOS debugging bits from PIPECONF

Spotted by staring at debug output of an (as it turns out) totally
unrelated bug.

v2: I've totally failed to do the s/pipe/i/ correctly, spotted by
Chris Wilson.
