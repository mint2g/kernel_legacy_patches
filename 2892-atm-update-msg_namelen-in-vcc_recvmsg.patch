Subject: [PATCH 2892/3390] atm: update msg_namelen in vcc_recvmsg()

[ Upstream commit 9b3e617f3df53822345a8573b6d358f6b9e5ed87 ]

The current code does not fill the msg_name member in case it is set.
It also does not set the msg_namelen member to 0 and therefore makes
net/socket.c leak the local, uninitialized sockaddr_storage variable
to userland -- 128 bytes of kernel stack memory.

Fix that by simply setting msg_namelen to 0 as obviously nobody cared
about vcc_recvmsg() not filling the msg_name in case it was set.
