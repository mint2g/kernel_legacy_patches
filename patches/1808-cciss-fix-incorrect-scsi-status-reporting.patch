Subject: [PATCH 1808/3390] cciss: fix incorrect scsi status reporting

commit b0cf0b118c90477d1a6811f2cd2307f6a5578362 upstream.

Delete code which sets SCSI status incorrectly as it's already been set
correctly above this incorrect code.  The bug was introduced in 2009 by
commit b0e15f6db111 ("cciss: fix typo that causes scsi status to be
lost.")
