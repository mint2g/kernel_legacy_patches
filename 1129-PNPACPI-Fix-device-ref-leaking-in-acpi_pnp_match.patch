Subject: [PATCH 1129/3390] PNPACPI: Fix device ref leaking in acpi_pnp_match

commit 89e96ada572fb216e582dbe3f64e1a6939a37f74 upstream.

During testing pci root bus removal, found some root bus bridge is not freed.
If booting with pnpacpi=off, those hostbridge could be freed without problem.
It turns out that some devices reference are not released during acpi_pnp_match.
that match should not hold one device ref during every calling.
Add pu_device calling before returning.
