Subject: [PATCH 0339/3390] xfs: use doalloc flag in xfs_qm_dqattach_one()

commit db3e74b582915d66e10b0c73a62763418f54c340 upstream

The doalloc arg in xfs_qm_dqattach_one() is a flag that indicates
whether a new area to handle quota information will be allocated
if needed. Originally, it was passed to xfs_qm_dqget(), but has
been removed by the following commit (probably by mistake):

	commit 8e9b6e7fa4544ea8a0e030c8987b918509c8ff47
	Author: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
	Date:   Sun Feb 8 21:51:42 2009 +0100

	xfs: remove the unused XFS_QMOPT_DQLOCK flag

As the result, xfs_qm_dqget() called from xfs_qm_dqattach_one()
never allocates the new area even if it is needed.

This patch gives the doalloc arg to xfs_qm_dqget() in
xfs_qm_dqattach_one() to fix this problem.
