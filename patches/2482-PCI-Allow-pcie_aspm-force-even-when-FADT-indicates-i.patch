Subject: [PATCH 2482/3390] PCI: Allow pcie_aspm=force even when FADT indicates
 it is unsupported

commit 9e16721498b0c3d3ebfa0b503c63d35c0a4c0642 upstream.

Right now using pcie_aspm=force will not enable ASPM if the FADT indicates
ASPM is unsupported.  However, the semantics of force should probably allow
for this, especially as they did before 3c076351c4 ("PCI: Rework ASPM
disable code")

This patch just skips the clearing of any ASPM setup that the firmware has
carried out on this bus if pcie_aspm=force is being used.
