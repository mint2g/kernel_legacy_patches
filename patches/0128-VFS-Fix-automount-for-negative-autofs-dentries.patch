Subject: [PATCH 0128/3390] VFS: Fix automount for negative autofs dentries

commit 5a30d8a2b8ddd5102c440c7e5a7c8e1fd729c818 upstream.
[ backport for 3.0.x: LOOKUP_PARENT => LOOKUP_CONTINUE by Chuck Ebbert
<cebbert@redhat.com> ]

Autofs may set the DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT flag on negative dentries.  These
need attention from the automounter daemon regardless of the LOOKUP_FOLLOW flag.
