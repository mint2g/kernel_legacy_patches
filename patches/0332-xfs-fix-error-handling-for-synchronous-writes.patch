Subject: [PATCH 0332/3390] xfs: fix error handling for synchronous writes

If removed storage while synchronous buffer write underway,
"xfslogd" hangs.

"xfs: fix error handling for synchronous writes"

Given that xfs_bwrite actually does the shutdown already after
waiting for the b_iodone completion and given that we actually
found that calling xfs_force_shutdown from inside
xfs_buf_iodone_callbacks was a major contributor the problem
it better to drop this call.
