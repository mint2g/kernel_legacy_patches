Subject: [PATCH 0346/3390] eCryptfs: Flush file in vma close

commit 32001d6fe9ac6b0423e674a3093aa56740849f3b upstream.

Dirty pages weren't being written back when an mmap'ed eCryptfs file was
closed before the mapping was unmapped. Since f_ops->flush() is not
called by the munmap() path, the lower file was simply being released.
This patch flushes the eCryptfs file in the vm_ops->close() path.
